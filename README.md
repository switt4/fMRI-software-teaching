# fMRI-software-teaching
Repository with teaching materials for running a single fMRI dataset through SPM12, FSL, and AFNI.


**Please read before proceeding**

The teaching materials in this wiki are designed to help new researchers get experience running a single fMRI dataset through a number of popular fMRI processing toolboxes.  New researchers using these materials should not expect to become an expert in any of the toolboxes after working through the tutorials, however, they should gain a better comfort level interacting with the toolbox interfaces and how to perform the basic steps for fMRI data analysis.  While effort has been made to ensure that the tutorial materials demonstrate good practices for each toolbox, the author of these materials makes no guarantee that the teaching materials presented here represent best practices for each toolbox.
